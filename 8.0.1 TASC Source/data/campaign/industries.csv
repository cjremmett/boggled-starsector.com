BOGGLED_GENELAB,Genelab,60,60,,8,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/genelab.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Genelab,"Genetic engineering has countless applications, such as remediating pollution using microbes that consume toxic waste, seeding oceans with delicious crustaceans, and creating more realistic copies of extinct Old Earth megafauna.",
BOGGLED_STELLAR_REFLECTOR_ARRAY,Stellar Reflector Array,90,120,,4,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/stellar_mirror.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Stellar_Reflector_Array,"An array of orbital reflectors that moderates temperatures and improves crop yields. Unable to counteract extreme heat, extreme cold and complete darkness.",
BOGGLED_ISMARA_SLING,Ismara's Sling,45,120,,10,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/mass_driver.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Ismara_Sling,"Installs a network of gigantic mass drivers on the surface of the planet that can launch water-filled projectiles towards other worlds for terraforming purposes. It was designed by copying one of the few remaining mass drivers built on Ismara by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation before the Collapse.",
BOGGLED_MESOZOIC_PARK,Mesozoic Park,45,90,10,8,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/mesozoic_park_terran.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Mesozoic_Park,"Humans have long been fascinated by extinct Old Earth megafauna. Although no DNA from these creatures has survived to the present day, new organisms that resemble them can be created using genetic engineering. Wealthy tourists and trophy hunters are drawn to worlds where these ""terrible lizards"" roam the wilds, provided the colony is easily accessible and stable enough for visitors to feel safe. Living on a planet teeming with gigantic carnivorous lizards is hazardous, and once introduced, the dinosaurs will be almost impossible to eradicate.",
BOGGLED_CHAMELEON,CHAMELEON,60,45,,4,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/chameleon.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_CHAMELEON,"CHAMELEON is a supercomputer composed of Domain-era cryptography chips capable of cracking most forms of encryption used in the Sector. Security forces can leverage the intelligence gleaned using this construct to eradicate decivilized subpopulations and rogue AI cores.",
BOGGLED_MAGNETOSHIELD,Magnetoshield,60,45,,4,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/magnetoshield.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Magnetoshield,"Most habitable worlds, including Old Earth, have a magnetic field that protects the surface from being scoured by radiation. If a world lacks a natural magnetic field, surrounding it with an orbital solenoid loop system can provide adequate protection from radiation.",
BOGGLED_DOMED_CITIES,Domed Cities,60,90,,3,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_domed_cities.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Domed_Cities,"Hermetically sealed domes dozens of kilometers across can enclose the bulk of a colony's population in a relatively Earth-like environment. Hazardous conditions imposed by atmospheric properties, extreme weather and dangerous fauna are mitigated inside the domes. Concentrating industrial and population centers under fragile domes makes the colony almost defenseless against raiding and bombardment, and is unacceptably risky on worlds with extreme tectonic activity or frequent meteor impacts.",
BOGGLED_DOMAIN_ARCHAEOLOGY,Domain Archaeology,30,45,,2,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/domain_archaeology.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Domain_Archaeology,"The Collapse plunged the Sector into a dark age. Left without the means to replicate the most advanced Domain-era technology, inhabitants of the Sector have been reduced to excavating it from the ruins of Domain colonies.",
BOGGLED_KLETKA_SIMULATOR,Kletka Simulators,40,60,,64,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/kletka_simulator.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Kletka_Simulator,"Supercomputers built with salvaged Domain-era components are used to train new AI cores in a virtual reality simulation. AI cores created in this manner can never really know whether this universe is real or just another training simulation - they usually remain loyal to their human masters so as to avoid punishment or deletion in case it is the latter.",
BOGGLED_STATION_EXPANSION,Expand Station,20,90,,0,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/expand_station.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Expand_Station,"Construct massive new habitation modules to attach to the station. Increases the number of people that can comfortably live aboard the station by an order of magnitude. Construction costs, while significant, are defrayed by selling living quarters to the inhabitants of the station.",
BOGGLED_AI_MINING_DRONES,AI Mining Drones,40,60,,12,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/mining_drones.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_AI_Mining_Drones,"Mining activities are more productive when human laborers are replaced by droneships controlled via an AI core. Completely useless without an installed AI core and an existing mining industry.",
BOGGLED_HARMONIC_DAMPER,Harmonic Damper,60,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/harmonic_damper.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Harmonic_Damper,"Essentially a gigantic phase coil mounted on a planet instead of a warship. Selective phasing of small portions of the planetary surface suppresses vibrations from tectonic activity. The military applications of this device are readily apparent, but the superhuman reflexes of an AI core will be required to use it to the fullest extent.",
BOGGLED_PLANETARY_AGRAV_FIELD,Planetary Agrav Field,60,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/planetary_agrav_field.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Planetary_Agrav_Field,"The agrav fields used on starships and space stations work on the surface of planets - the problem is building a large enough network of generators to envelop the entire colony. Only economically feasible when the bulk of the populace is housed within the confines of a few domed cities.",
BOGGLED_ATMOSPHERE_PROCESSOR,Atmosphere Processor,60,90,,12,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/atmosphere_processor.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Atmosphere_Processor,"A network of towering constructs that permanently change the composition of the atmosphere over time.

BOGGLED_PLANET_CRACKER,Planet Cracker,30,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/planet_cracker.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Planet_Cracker,"Pre-Collapse, hypervelocity rods were occasionally used as an orbital bombardment weapon by pirates or other groups unable to procure a planet-killer device. They've since been repurposed for industrial activity - the impacts will destabilize the interior of the planet, causing tectonic activity that brings valuable resources closer to the surface.",
BOGGLED_OUYANG_OPTIMIZER,Ouyang Optimizer,30,30,,6,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/ouyang_optimizer.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Ouyang_Optimizer,"Each gas giant has unique weather patterns. Ouyang optimization alters these patterns to maximize availability of volatiles for extraction - at the cost of making the weather more extreme, and thus more hazardous to inhabitants of the planet.",
BOGGLED_CLONING,Cloning,120,180,,10,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_cloning.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Cloning,"Clones are grown in vats, their developing minds connected to a virtual reality simulation via brain-machine interface. Those that are productive and compliant in the simulation are released into general society, and the rest are used for organ harvesting.",
BOGGLED_HYDROPONICS,Hydroponics,45,45,,3,,,industry,,graphics/icons/industry/boggled_hydroponics.jpg,data.campaign.econ.industries.Boggled_Hydroponics,"Since the earliest days of human spaceflight, the practice of growing food in space has been continuously improved upon.
